Assignments for Bloc

Checkpoint 1
Hey Zach,

So for my first checkpoint assignment, I think I will excel at the following:

_**Commit the time.**_

**Make good use of your mentor**

*Ride the roller coaster.*

_**Learn to forage.**_

I will struggle with avoiding lulls, but it's something I have continuously worked on so I'm hoping I can continue to be vigilant about time management while here.

Please leave me some feedback on this, thanks!

Best, Aaron
